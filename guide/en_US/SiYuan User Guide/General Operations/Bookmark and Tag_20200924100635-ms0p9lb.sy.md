## Bookmark
{: id="20200927101456-glguy5l"}

If you need to "favorite" a content block, you can move the mouse to the block identifier on the left side of the content block in the editor and click to display a drop-down menu. After selecting a bookmark, the block can be added to the favorite. Collection of document blocks is not supported. If there is a need to collect document blocks, you can write the title of the document in the document and achieve this by collecting the title block.

Currently, only the built-in bookmark marker (✨💡️⏳) is supported to name bookmarks, and custom bookmark markers will be supported in the future. #TODO#

All favorite content blocks will be listed in the bookmark tab (<kbd>Alt 3</kbd> / <kbd>⌘ 3</kbd>). If you want to cancel the collection, select Delete in the drop-down menu of the content block ID.

## Tag
{: id="20200927101456-ztmkjcn"}

The tag is used to mark the block in the content block. The syntax is to wrap the tag identifier with two `#` in the first and one after the other, like this `#Tag#`.

Tag support hierarchical levels, so that content blocks can be sorted more easily. Use `/` to separate different levels, like this `#A/B/C#`.
